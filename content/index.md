Welcome to our **Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition** campaign set in the groovy, paranoid 1970s! This knowledge base serves as your player resource hub for our **West Marches-style** investigation series.

## Campaign Overview

**System**: Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition  
**Setting**: United States, 1970s  
**Style**: West Marches episodic investigations  
**Tone**: Cosmic horror meets period paranoia

You play as agents of the **Bureau of Transdimensional Control (BTC)**, a hastily-formed interagency task force investigating reality-bending incidents across America. Each session focuses on a standalone "case file," allowing players to drop in and out freely while building a shared universe of mysteries and horrors.
