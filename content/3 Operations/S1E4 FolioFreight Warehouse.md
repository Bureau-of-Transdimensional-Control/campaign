### FIELD REPORT

**SUBMITTED BY:** 
**DATE OF SUBMISSION:** September 30, 1972

**INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY:**  
Team attempted direct approach to listed [[FolioFreight]] warehouse address but encountered anomalous concealment effects preventing location of facility despite accurate coordinates. Local intelligence gathering through waitress "Betty" revealed actual warehouse location and provided initial intelligence on book transport operations conducted by four-person teams with regular schedules.

Upon arrival at actual warehouse facility following Betty's directions, team discovered systematic destruction of all textual and photographic information through unknown anomalous means already in progress. Time-critical evidence recovery operation initiated with approximately 15 minutes remaining before total information loss.

Facility search revealed:
- Main warehouse area with empty shipping containers and degrading documentation
- Storage area with extensive book collections undergoing systematic text erasure
- Office space with personnel records and operational documentation in advanced degradation
- Concealed room containing five portrait frames of apparent organizational leadership

**ENCOUNTER LOG:** 
No direct combat engagement. During intelligence gathering phase at diner, two subjects observed departing area in Plymouth Fury (License: Missouri HXJ-429). Subjects not directly observed at warehouse facility.
