# CASE FILE #72-09-22-1: Operation Sphinx Mirror

### BRIEFING

**DATE:** September 22, 1972  
**LOCATION:** North Star Optics Complex, Highway 61, Missouri

**SITUATION SUMMARY:**  
Four local teenagers (ages 14-16) reported missing after bicycle excursion to abandoned defense contractor facility. Local sheriff's department investigation noted unexplained "flashes of blue light inside unpowered facility" concurrent with disappearances. BTC automated filter PHOS-2 flagged incident as possible extranormal luminous phenomena requiring immediate assessment.

**MISSION PARAMETERS:** 
- Primary objective: Locate missing persons and determine cause of anomalous light emissions. 
- Secondary objective: Assess potential transdimensional breach indicators under cover of industrial hazmat inspection (laser disposal survey). Containment protocols authorized if phenomena confirmed hostile.

**AUTHORIZED EQUIPMENT:** Standard field kit

### FIELD REPORT

**SUBMITTED BY:** Agents [[Dark T]], [[Howard Reiner]], [[Henry Jackson]]  
**DATE OF SUBMISSION:** September 23, 1972

**INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY:**  
Team arrived North Star Optics 2045 hours, bypassed local law enforcement perimeter. Initial contact with facility caretaker Andrew "Andy" Holmes revealed extreme psychological distress. Subject exhibited signs of acute alcohol intoxication and reported encounter with "sandy creature that exploded into sparks" when illuminated. Holmes became unresponsive due to continued alcohol consumption.

Physical evidence recovery: Granular silicate material consistent with desert sand discovered near Hangar A entrance. Material collected for laboratory analysis - **significant anomaly noted: sand exhibits temporal temperature differential and microscopic crystalline structures unknown to regional geology.**

Primary discovery: Intact optical projection device designated "Sphinx 400" located within sealed hangar. Device operational despite facility power disconnection since 1969. Equipment examination revealed:

- High-intensity arc lamp system (3kW capacity)
- Precision-ground quartz lens assembly with unidentified metallic inlays
- Rotating slide carousel containing 6 photographic plates of unusual composition
- Mechanism actively cycling at regular 70-minute intervals

**ENCOUNTER LOG:**  
Initial projection test conducted using patrol vehicle as target surface. **Result: Immediate manifestation of granular matter within vehicle interior matching collected sand samples.** Confirmed transdimensional aperture properties.

Systematic slide examination revealed multiple destination coordinates:

1. Desert environment - primary manifestation zone
2. Megalithic structure under alien stellar configuration
3. Zero-gravity void space (avoided)
4. Luminescent jungle ecosystem
5. Vast library complex with humanoid custodian entity
6. Complete darkness zone (avoided after preliminary scan)

Brief contact established with Library entity - described as tall, robed figure demonstrating telepathic communication abilities. Entity expressed concern regarding "contamination protocols" when team introduced material from primary desert zone. **Note: No audio recordings possible due to non-verbal nature of communication.**

Critical phase: Team entered primary desert manifestation to locate missing persons. **Four subjects recovered in severely dehydrated condition approximately 400 meters from portal entry point.** Immediate environmental threats identified: approaching sandstorm system and three hostile entities of ambulatory sand composition advancing on recovery position.

Emergency extraction initiated via projectile disruption of optical system. Portal collapse sequence nearly resulted in team and civilian casualties due to powerful suction effect. All personnel retained in baseline reality through coordinated physical anchoring procedures.

### OPERATIONAL RESULTS

**EVIDENCE SECURED:**

- Sand samples exhibiting non-terrestrial properties _(Evidence Locker [[72-09-22-1-A]])_
- Photographic documentation of projection apparatus _(Evidence Locker [[72-09-22-1-B]])_
- Six (6) photographic slides recovered from "Sphinx 400" projection carousel *(Evidence Locker [[72-09-22-1-ะก]])*  
- Fragmented remains of "Sphinx 400" projection apparatus *(Evidence Locker [[72-09-22-1-D]])*  

**MEDICAL STATUS:** Four civilian subjects hospitalized for severe dehydration and exposure. Cover story: Heat exhaustion during unauthorized exploration of industrial site. All subjects experiencing mild amnesia regarding "dream-like" experiences in "endless desert." Psychiatric evaluation recommended but not pursued to avoid further attention.

**ADDENDUM:** Historical research indicates facility connection to 1969 disappearance of Dr. Gerald Whitcomb.
