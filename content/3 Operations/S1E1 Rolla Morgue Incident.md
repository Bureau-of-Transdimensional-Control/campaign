### FIELD REPORT
**SUBMITTED BY:** [[Eric Prise]], [[Dark T]]  
**DATE OF SUBMISSION:** September 9, 1972  

**INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY:**  
Team arrived at Rolla General at 2300 hours. Initial interview with night security guard (Samuel Hayes, age 47) revealed witness account of "strange shadows" near morgue entrance during previous three nights. Subject believed he had seen a large cat (puma or lynx) and reported same to local police. Subject appeared genuinely disturbed but coherent.

Examination of morgue records revealed no discernible pattern among missing cadavers - victims varied in age (23-67), cause of death, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background. No common medical conditions or treatments identified.

Examination of morgue facility (basement level) revealed no immediate signs of forced entry through conventional access points. However, detailed search uncovered concealed entrance behind refrigeration unit #4. Opening measured approximately 90cm x 120cm, professionally concealed.

Passage led to subterranean tunnel system of considerable age. Tunnels showed evidence of recent use: fresh scratches on walls, disturbed dust patterns, and organic residue.

**ENCOUNTER LOG:**  
At approximately 0115 hours, team encountered three (3) unidentified humanoid entities in tunnel section. Entities were discovered actively consuming human remains, identified as missing morgue cadavers.

Entities displayed following characteristics:
- Canine-like facial features with pronounced dentition
- Elongated limbs terminating in claw-like appendages
- Bipedal locomotion with occasional quadrupedal movement
- Grayish, mottled skin with minimal hair coverage
- Estimated height: 1.7m to 1.8m

Lead entity attempted verbal communication in what appeared to be French. Team immediately engaged hostile entities with lethal force.

Engagement resulted in termination of two (2) entities. Third entity escaped via unmapped tunnel branch. No team casualties reported. Minor lacerations treated on-site.
