This is a short guide to playing Call of Cthulhu 7th edition. Here we will examine key mechanics, the dice engine, familiarize ourselves with the character sheet and the character creation process.

# Key Mechanics

As in any RPG, characters face difficulties, and skills and characteristics help them overcome these challenges. Skill levels range from 0 to 100 for humans. To determine how successful a character was in using a skill, the player rolls a d100. There are several possible check results.

| Fumble | Failure | Regular Success | Hard Success | Extreme Success | Critical Success |
| ------ | ------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 100    | > skill | ≤ skill         | ≤ ½ skill    | ≤ ⅕ skill       | 01               |

That is, to successfully pass a check, the dice result must be below the skill value.


**Examples.** The character sheet usually shows 4 numbers for a skill.

| Skill             |     | Reg | Half | Fifth |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | ---- | ----- |
| Spot Hidden (20%) |     | 65  | 32   | 13    |

The player rolled 54. This falls in the interval between 65 and 32, meaning it's a regular success.

| Skill             |     | Reg | Half | Fifth |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | ---- | ----- |
| Persuade (10%)    |     |     |      |       |

In this case **the** character did not develop the skill and can **only** use the base value, which in this case is 10. The player rolled 37, meaning it's a **failure**.
