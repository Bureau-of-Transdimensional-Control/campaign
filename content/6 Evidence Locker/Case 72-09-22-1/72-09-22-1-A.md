## EVIDENCE LOG 72-09-22-1-A

**CASE:** [[S1E3 Operation Sphinx Mirror|72-09-22-1]]
**CLASSIFICATION:**  
**DATE RECOVERED:** September 22, 1972  
**LOCATION:** North Star Optics Complex, Hangar A entrance, Missouri  
**STATUS:** Awaiting examination

### DESCRIPTION

**Type:** Granular material, approximately 800 grams  
**Condition:** Stable, sealed container 
**Storage:** Evidence Vault B-7, room temperature

**Initial Field Observations:**
- Color: Deep black with occasional dark bronze metallic flecks
- Grain size: 0.1-0.8mm diameter, consistent with fine to medium sand
- Texture: Smooth, non-adherent particles; minimal cohesion when dry
- Temperature: Consistently 8-11Â°C below ambient room temperature

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Hexagonal crystal lattice formations unknown to terrestrial mineralogy
- High-intensity illumination disrupts entity cohesion - confirmed method for neutralizing hostile sand constructs

**Additional Notes:**
- Material recovered as residual matter following destruction of hostile sand construct entity
- Similar substance observed manifesting spontaneously during transdimensional portal testing
- When introduced to alternate dimensional environment, caused "protocol violations" according to resident entity
- Appears to originate from desert dimension accessed via "Sphinx 400" projection device

**PENDING ANALYSIS:** Authorization required
