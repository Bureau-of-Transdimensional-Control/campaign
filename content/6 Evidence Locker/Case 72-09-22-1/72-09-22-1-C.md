## EVIDENCE LOG 72-09-22-1-С

**CASE:** [[S1E3 Operation Sphinx Mirror|72-09-22-1]]  
**CLASSIFICATION:**   
**DATE RECOVERED:** September 22, 1972  
**LOCATION:** North Star Optics Complex, Hangar A slide carousel, Missouri  
**STATUS:** Secured pending analysis

### DESCRIPTION

**Type:** Six (6) photographic slides, 35mm format  
**Condition:** Mixed - one destroyed, five damaged but potentially recoverable  
**Storage:**  

**Initial Field Observations:**
- Format: Standard 35mm slide mounts, plastic frames with cardboard backing
- Labeling: Each mount hand-numbered 1-6, additional notation "Δ-Series"
- Film type: Unknown emulsion, unusual thickness (approximately 0.15mm vs standard 0.13mm)
- Mount condition: Heat-warped frames, several cracked plastic edges
- Origin: Recovered from carousel position #3 active, others from remaining slots

**Individual Slide Assessment:**

**Slide 1 (Desert Environment):**
- Condition: Completely destroyed - emulsion layer melted and bubbled beyond recognition
- Thermal damage: Extreme heat exposure, film base warped and discolored
- Recovery status: Irreparable, no visual information remaining

**Slides 2-6:**
- Condition: Heat and mechanical damage, but emulsion partially intact
- Thermal effects: Edge discoloration, minor emulsion softening
- Mechanical damage: Hairline cracks across film surface, frame deformation
- Visual content: Partially obscured but geometric patterns visible through damage
- Unusual properties: Film appears to contain embedded metallic traces

**Physical Characteristics:**
- All slides heavier than standard photographic materials
- Metallic appearance to emulsion surface under direct light
- Unusual color spectrum - images appear to shift between blue-green and silver
- Frame markings include symbols not consistent with commercial photography
- Strong chemical odor similar to photographic developer but with metallic component

**Additional Notes:**
- Slides do not match any known commercial film stock or processing method
- Manufacturing appears to be custom laboratory work, possibly experimental
- Heat damage pattern consistent with proximity to exploding arc lamp
- One empty slot in carousel suggests original set may have contained 7 slides
- Slide mounts show signs of frequent handling despite facility abandonment

**PENDING ANALYSIS:** Restoration assessment required before further examination. Specialized photographic equipment may be necessary for recovery attempts.
