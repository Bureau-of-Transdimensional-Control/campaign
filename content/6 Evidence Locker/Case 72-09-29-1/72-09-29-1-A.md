### DESCRIPTION

**Type:** Crew shift schedule documentation, partially erased  
**Quantity:** Two (2) pages, standard letter size  
**Condition:** Severe deterioration - estimated 70-80% text loss  
**Storage:** Evidence Vault A-3, climate controlled environment

**Initial Field Observations:**

- Paper type: Standard mimeograph paper, white, moderate quality
- Text method: Purple carbon reproduction, typical office duplicator
- Degradation pattern: Progressive text fading from bottom to top
- Recovery timing: Extracted during active erasure event, approximately 3 minutes remaining before total loss
- Physical integrity: Paper structure intact, no burn or chemical damage

**Recoverable Information:**
- Header partially visible: "FolioFreight Logistics - Weekly Crew Schedule"
- Date range fragment: "September ...-29, 1972"
- Crew designations visible:
    - "Crew: Hollow Ember - ACTIVE"
    - "Crew: Book of Dogs - ACTIVE"
    - "Crew: Fourth Book - NULLIFIED"
    - "Crew: Myriad Voice - ACTIVE"
    - "Crew: Blood Ledger - ACTIVE"
    - "Crew: Glass Tooth - HOLD"
- Route notation: "Warehouse 7 → ... → Return 0400"
- Personnel count: "4-man teams" notation repeated throughout document
- Time stamps: Several entries showing "2130 departure" and "0400 return"

**Second Page (Partial Recovery):**
- Next assignment designation for crew designation unclear due to erasure
- Mission type: "Retrieval operation"
- Location: Dogwood & Quill Books, Nashville, Tennessee
- Status notation: "Priority - immediate deployment"
- Additional routing information lost to degradation

**Anomalous Properties:**
- Text erasure occurred without heat, chemical, or physical contact
- Erasure rate: Approximately 15-20% text loss per minute during observation
- Pattern consistency: All affected documents showed identical degradation timing
- Selectivity: Only written information affected - paper, ink binding, and physical structure remained intact
- Reversibility: No known method to restore erased content attempted

**Field Recovery Notes:**
- Documents photographed immediately upon discovery - photographs also subject to degradation
- Removal from facility halted erasure process within 30 seconds of exit
- Additional documentation observed but lost to complete erasure before recovery possible

**PENDING ANALYSIS:** Document preservation techniques, comparison with known crew operational patterns, Nashville bookshop identification and surveillance
