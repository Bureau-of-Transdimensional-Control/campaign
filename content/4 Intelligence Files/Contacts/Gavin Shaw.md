## GAVIN SHAW

### Description

Gavin Shaw, 41, leads a double life—insurance adjuster by day, amateur historian by night. His weekend volunteer work at the Ironhaven Heritage Institute caught Director Hardwell's attention through her network of academic contacts. She personally recruited him in 1971, recognizing that his meticulous nature and access to historical archives could prove invaluable.

Shaw approaches his Bureau work with the careful precision of someone processing insurance claims, though his reports tend toward excessive footnoting and hand-drawn diagrams. The horn-rimmed glasses and brown tweed jacket he wears to the Institute mark him as trying perhaps too hard to look scholarly. While he understands the general nature of what the Bureau faces—Hardwell was surprisingly frank during recruitment—his enthusiasm often outpaces his field experience, as the September incident demonstrated when Subject #2 caught him off-guard.
